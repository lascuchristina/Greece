                3. 80% of Greece is made up of mountains
            </div>
            <div class="overflow-text">
                When you think of Greece, you probably picture sandy shores, blue ocean, whitewashed buildings and blue domes. But one of the most surprising facts about Greece reveals that the majority of the country is actually mountains. It’s one of the most mountainous countries in Europe, with 80% of the country covered in mountains. Don’t forget to pack a good pair of walking shoes!

                4. No part of Greece is more than 137 kilometres away from the ocean
            </div>
            <div class="overflow-text">
                Greece may be 80% mountains… But if you associate a beautiful Mediterranean coastline with Greece, you’re also right! Greece has an impressive coastline of 16,000 kilometres (9,942 miles), making it the 10th longest coastline in the world. Plus, no part of the country is more than 137 kilometres (85 miles) away from the ocean. That’s a lot of water!

                5. Greece has a diverse array of wildlife
            </div>
            <div class="overflow-text">
                With all those incredible coastal and mountainous landscapes, it’s no wonder that Greece is home to some of the world’s most unique animals. Some animals are even found only on specific Greek Islands, including seals, turtles, frogs, lizards, snakes, fish, butterflies, mice, and even the Kri-kri (the Cretan Wild Goat). Some fun facts about Greece for birdwatchers – there are 240 bird species in the country. Consider planning your trip for winter as this is when over 100,000 birds and hundreds of birds migrate to the wetlands of Greece each year.

                6. More tourists visit Greece every year than the entire Greek population
            </div>
            <div class="overflow-text">
                It’s no secret that Greece is one of the world’s most popular countries to visit. But did you know that over 17 million tourists visit Greece each year? That is almost double the total population of Greece. It’s one of the only countries in the world with tourist numbers that double its population (along with Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg). Tourism makes up around 20% of Greece’s GDP, which is also one of the highest percentages of any industrialised country.

                7. The capital of Greece is named after the goddess Athena
            </div>
            <div class="overflow-text">
                Athena is the Goddess of wisdom and warfare – and the Patron of Athens. According to Greek Mythology, Athena and Poseidon fought over the right to name the city, and the Greeks chose Athena to be the Patron of Athens. Both gods offered the people a gift, with Athena gifting an olive tree and Poseidon offering water, but the people chose the olive tree as it was of a higher value since it could provide oil, food and wood.

                8. Greece is the third largest producer of olives
            </div>
            <div class="overflow-text">
                The olive tree continues to be a big part of Greek culture to this day… The country has over 120 million olive trees and produces 2.2 million metric tons of olives every year. That makes it the third-largest producer of olives in the world, after Spain and Italy. Greece also produces more varieties of olives than any other country. One of the most interesting facts about Greece and olives is that some of the country’s olive trees that were planted in the 13th century are still bearing fruit today.

            <div class="overflow-text">
                They say the world’s a stage – and that’s certainly true in Athens! With 148 theatrical stages, the city has the most theatrical stages in the world, even beating out London’s West End and New York’s Broadway. It’s fitting for Athens to hold this title since it’s the place where the art of acting and theatre was born.
